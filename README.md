A futile project attempting to shamelessly control the chaos in my life

For now building the basic functionalities of a database, namely maintaining and managing data in Excel files (which represent my DB files).
I find it more entertaining to build those functionalities on my own, rather than rely on an already existing DB system. It would be
quite interesting and informative to learn by oneself the challenges of database management and potential solutions to those challenges.
